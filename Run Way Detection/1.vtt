00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.760
Landing is one of the most
critical phases during a flight.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.200
It is the second thing a pilot learns in
training after basic flight control and

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.940
recovery techniques.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.890
Touchdown is the first phase.

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.550
An aircraft has to dump all this kinetic
energy that keeps the aircraft flying.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.390
It's a fine maneuver that should be
done right, not too soft, not too hard.

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.330
Landing also is one of
the most dangerous phases and

8
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.922
most aircraft accidents take place
either during the take off or landing.

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.720
Instrumental guidance systems are,
therefore,

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.569
a great advantage to the pilots.

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.200
In this project,

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.840
we focus on runway detection by
using image filtering techniques.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.040
Our runway detection algorithm
is based on video frames.

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.270
This means that we have a camera
mounted on the aircraft

15
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.020
which is recording the approach.

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.510
The frames captured by the camera is then
forwarded to image processing algorithms.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.180
To easily spot the visual
characteristic of the runway,

18
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.540
we will filter out other details
than the edges in the frame.

19
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.660
This makes the image simpler to process

20
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.450
because now the picture only contains
the most basic properties for

21
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.190
determining a square runway in
an otherwise diverse landscape.

22
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.710
Okay, so
runway detection already exists but

23
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.810
now we want to build the next generation
of landing system based on IoT.

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.050
Let's consider the aircraft
being a complex sensor system

25
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.550
capable of recording and
sending filtered video frames.

26
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.900
These frames can now be sent
to a Cloud server on ground,

27
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.480
in which high performance algorithms

28
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.830
such as deep learning can be applied on
the video frames to optimize the landing.

29
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.740
This type of heavy processing can not
be executed on site because of lacking

30
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.900
processing power and it must therefore
be forwarded to a Cloud server.

31
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.810
Of course, with data transfer,
we expose a risk to leak

32
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.600
confidential information that could
endanger the safety of the aircraft.

33
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520
Check out Norse, my website,

34
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.340
that visualizes the realtime attempts
to break IT security worldwise.

35
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.030
The link must, therefore,
be secured before data transfer can begin.

36
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.730
Let's recap the project.

37
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.870
Your task is to build an autonomous
landing system or aircraft.

38
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.830
The system should detect
a wrong way from a video frame.

39
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.270
This is done by recording the landing
with a camera mounted on the aircraft,

40
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.360
the image is filtered by an edge detection
algorithm and the filtered image is

41
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.930
encrypted and sent to a Cloud server for
further processing over a secure link.

42
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.459
This course is built on three previous
courses of this specialization.

43
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.180
From the course embedded
operating system and

44
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.910
hardware, you will apply your skills for
planning the embedded hardware platform.

45
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.480
Planning the performance required for
the processing, the cost of building such

46
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.390
system and
the energy such a system would consume.

47
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.470
You will need to program a lot in this
course and most of the programming

48
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.582
will be based on the course
development of realtime systems.

49
00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:38.400
The realtime processing of system must
match the system requirements and

50
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.450
correct scheduling must be ensured.

51
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.840
Finally, you will need to utilize your
skills from course web connectivity and

52
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.630
security in embedded systems to
establish the web connectivity and

53
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.750
ensure the secure transfer
of data to the Cloud server.
