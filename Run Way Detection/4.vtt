00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
Okay, so what exactly you should provide to pass this course?

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.975
Let's define this more precisely,

3
00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.420
as a list of deliverables.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.615
There are two main things to provide,

5
00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.860
code and the report.

6
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.840
The code includes all algorithms you have been using in

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
freeRTOS as well as the system code itself and the tasks.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.682
In summary, you should make zip file on

9
00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:30.740
all files and folders in the root directory of the project.

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.960
This package can then easily be extracted by

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.850
the reviewer and impor- imported to the original studio.

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.480
It will become a fairly large file, but this is okay.

13
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.910
Next, you need to

14
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.109
provide a written report about your design choices and the adoption of the algorithms.

15
00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.990
More specifically, the report should include

16
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.240
configuration parameters of freeRTOS itself such

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.885
as parameters and freeRTOS coffee cup edge,

18
00:01:00.885 --> 00:01:04.152
configurations about the TCP connection,

19
00:01:04.152 --> 00:01:08.440
parameters regarded to scheduling and so on.

20
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.670
Details above all tasks created in freeRTOS,

21
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.973
including how you determine the schedule in freeRTOS?

22
00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:21.570
How we integrated the edge detection algorithm and

23
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.060
a screen shot of running algorithm we did before and after a shot of an image.

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.500
Same story with the encryption algorithm.

25
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.260
You are- you also need to include the output from some encrypted data of your choice.

26
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.459
You also must explain how you implemented the TCP client and then

27
00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:49.610
include the screenshot of the client transmitting data successfully to the TCP server.

28
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.095
Apart from the tasks,

29
00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:56.340
you should include relevant code and explanation about how you

30
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.300
handle the communication between the tasks in freeRTOS,

31
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.905
and why such choices were made.

32
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:07.650
And finally a screenshot of the running TCP server on the PC

33
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.890
that is successfully receiving the data packets from the TCP client.

34
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.765
But hey, there is more.

35
00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:19.420
Your report should include a discussion and references to relevant techniques and

36
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.965
hardware for interconnecting the camera to a real embedded hardware platform.

37
00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:31.555
Specifically, you must discuss resolution and the picture quality needed.

38
00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:35.960
How much energy is- is such as platform is consuming?

39
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.510
What is throughput requirement of the communication?

40
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.495
How about reliability?

41
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.780
And can you give a financial estimate of such a system?

42
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.470
The final part of the report should

43
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.170
include reference to choices for hardware platform and operating systems.

44
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.110
Particularly, explain the performance of the hardware and operating system,

45
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.085
the energy consumption,

46
00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:11.082
the availability- can you easily get the hardware and operating system?

47
00:03:11.082 --> 00:03:13.090
How about the costs?

48
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.340
And is this choice viable in a real industrial project?

49
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.400
Thanks for following the course and we wish you a good luck in implementing the project.
